# Employee Attendance on Raspberry Pi using Facial Recognition

## Abstract
With all the rapid changes in modern world, facial recognition been an integral part in almost all domains. From safety and security to industrialization, that concept grew largerly; in addition, utilizing that to identify objects and people in a quickly manner is a must in a fast growing economy. Many applications can take advantage of object detection. In our project, we are trying to record employee attendence using facial recognition on Raspberry Pi microcontroller.

## Problem
The current pandemic gave us new ways to leverage technology. Existing biometerics the likes of fingerprint requires contact with the device. This would raise a challenge in preventing the spread of the disease since surfaces may be contaminated with the virus. In our project, a contactless approach is what we look for; therefore, an object detection/facial recognition is what we aim to achieve.

## Data and models used
Our data is going to be combined with transfer learning and pre-trained models. GoogleNet and other several models would be incorporated to determine if a specific employee is counted present in the attendance system or an unknown alien is inside the organization premise.

## Tools and hardware
* Raspberry Pi 4
* Logitech USB webcam
* Numpy
* OpenCV
* PyTorch (or Keras)
* scikit-learn (Keras wrapper if decided on Keras)
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn 
* Twilio - Communication API (SMS)
